# Heart-Attack-Prediction-System ðŸ«€
## Heart disease remains the leading cause of mortality worldwide. Early detection and timely treatment are crucial for preventing heart attacks. This project aims to develop an AI-driven system that can predict the likelihood of heart attacks in individuals by analysing medical data.

### Objectives:
####     1.  To collect comprehensive health datasets including key indicators of cardiovascular health.
####     2.  To preprocess and analyse the data to identify significant predictors of heart attacks.
####     3.  To develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict heart attacks.
####     4.  To validate the modelâ€™s predictions against actual clinical outcomes.
